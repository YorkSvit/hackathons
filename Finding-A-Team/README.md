## Team building

If you're a team looking for a hacker, or if you're a hacker looking for a team, look no further.

### Hacker looking for a team

If you're a hacker, and you have the right skills but you don't have a team:
1. Open a new issue using the template [Hacker looking for a team](https://github.com/golemfactory/hackathons/issues/new?template=hacker-wants-team.md). Here you can introduce yourself and your skills. Feel free to add or create labels that match your skills.
2. Browse all open issues with the label team looking-for-hackers or creating-new-team.
3. If you find a team with an idea that you like, engage with them. We advise you to reference the issue above so that the team can learn more about you. 
4. After you join a team, please close your issue. 

### Team looking for a hacker

Open a new issue using the template [team wants a hacker](https://github.com/golemfactory/hackathons/issues/new?template=team-wants-hacker.md). Here you can pitch your idea to potential hackers. Feel free to add or create labels that match your project.
You can either wait for hackers to approach you, or recruit proactively browsing their profiles (all issues with the label looking-for-team) and engage with them.
When your team is complete, close your issue so that hackers will know that you’re complete. 

### Idea looking for a team

If you have a great idea, but you don’t have a team to bring it to life, open a new issue using the template [Idea for a team](https://github.com/golemfactory/hackathons/issues/new?template=idea-wants-a-team.md). Here you can pitch your idea and tell everyone why they should join you. Feel free to add or create labels that match your skills.
You can either wait for hackers to approach you, or recruit proactively browsing their profiles (all issues with the label looking-for-team) and engage with them.

When your team is complete, close your issue so that hackers will know that you’re complete. 

## Communication

Interacting through issues might be great to find an initial match, but you probably want to take the conversation off GitHub at some point.
You could meet in the Discord at https://chat.golem.network
You can also just directly leave your personal Discord username in your tracking issue.
