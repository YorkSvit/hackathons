# Golem Network Hackathons Code of Conduct

At Golem Network we want to create a place where everyone can build exciting things, regardless of the resources they have, in a safe and inclusive environment. This means that our Hackathon will have the same philosophy and any harmful and discriminating behaviour will not be tolerated and will result in the expulsion.

Judging will only be based on the code developed during the hackathon.

## Golem’s philosophy

At Golem, we believe in building software that reflects our ethos, and in the importance of protocol expressiveness as a consequence of technologists’ design principles choices.

We believe in universal and free internet access without boundaries of any kind, and that all communication networks should be protected and private, as well as data transfer. P2P technologies allow us to build networks where our privacy and accesses are not restrained by any third party.  Decentralized, alternative, distributed systems are essential to protect ourselves against the crescent surveillance and subsequent abuse of data and behavioural control.

Golem believes Software developers, architects, UI/UX designers, researchers and communicators working on OSS and Decentralized technologies, alternative and P2P networks should constantly work on better user education, onboarding and documentation. Today’s technologies still appear cumbersome, unaccessible.

Working openly and transparently to find best practices gets us closer to the goals we have: giving users back the control of their data, privacy, or resource administration. A self-sovereign internet is possible.

### Be Open and Respectful
As such, At Golem Network we want to create a place where everyone can build exciting things, regardless of the resources they have, in a safe and inclusive environment. This means that our Hackathon will have the same philosophy and any harmful and discriminating behaviour will not be tolerated and will result in the expulsion.

Judging will only be based on the code developed during the hackathon.

Be open to newcomers. Everyone, whatever their background is welcome to Golem.

Be respectful and kind to others.

Build cool things. At Golem Network hackathons we hack and build. Let your imagination run wild and build something nobody dared to do before.

Ask for help. Nobody knows everything, it’s not possible.

Decentralization: make public data available, protect private data

Hacking starts at the Hackathon. Not before.

Act and hack in good faith: if you find a bug or a vulnerability please report it as soon as possible.

Do not tolerate any discriminatory or harassing behaviour. If you witness, or are subject to, a discriminatory or harassing behaviour, report it immediately.


For additional details about what kinds of behavior are not tolerated, and the consequences of any misconduct we refer to the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/).
